        <h2>Makeup as a Form of Creative Expression</h2>
        <p>I've been experimenting with makeup since high school but really dove into it more during the pandemic. It's my favorite hobby and serves as both an outlet and a way to express my creativity. The pictures above show some close-up shots of looks I've done in the past. You might notice I look a bit more tired in some of them, that's probably because I had a lot of homework to get through, and doing my makeup was a fun way to distract myself for a bit. If I really like a look I make on the spot, I'll take a photo and recreate with more detail later. I'm especially into glitter eyeshadows, graphic liner, and experimenting with rhinestones to take my makeup to the next level.</p>
