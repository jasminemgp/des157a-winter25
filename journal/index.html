            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            <p><b>Date: </b>January 20, 2025</p>
            <p>Form Design Practices has evolved over the years and increasingly improved usability for it's users, still it is inevitable to come across poorly designed forms online. Some key practices that stood out in the article, <a href="urlhttps://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> by Salim Ansari, were not overloading the user with <i>complex</i> form questions first but rather <i>easy form questions first to reduce users form abandonment.</i> Most users are motivated to finish tasks they have started. Another practice that stood out was the use of <i>default values</i> in forms, it is key to do research prior to entering a default value in users forms to prevent submittal errors. Lastly, another practice that stood out to me was the <i>minmization of drop down menus</i> if a dropdown menu has less than 6 options, the designer could opt for radio buttons to easily display the array of options, reduce uneccessary clickks, and easily check multiple options. Overall Salim provided 20 tips to boost usability which were all insightful.</p>

            <p>
                <br>One form that demobstrates a best form practice would be the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/login">Khan Academy's</a> login page, although there are clearly direct labels on top of each input field and various CTA buttons that prompt the user to log in through Google, Apple, Facebook, or Clever.   </p>
