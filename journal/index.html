                <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
                <p>In the article  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> by Baskanderi, she mtated that modals have become a nightmare for many users in modern web pages, although not intentional they have occasionally been seen as a dreaded pop-up window. A modal is a child of the parent window that is used to display a message, blocking any interactivity from the main web page until it has been interacted with. Five recommended uses for Modals include, gaining a user’s attention, needing user inputs (sign up, log in), and showing additional information both in and out of context. Information deemed to be in context would be an enlarged image or video added onto the webpage, and an example of out of context information would be anything that is not directly related to the parent page such as notifications. It is important that modals are NOT used to display error, success, or warning messages. </p> <br> 

                    <h3>Anatomy of a Modal Window</h3>
                    <p>A Modal consists of five different elements; a title, button label, close label, it’s size, and a shadow to make it stand out. Modals must provide an easy way for users to escape, methods to escape include clicking outside the window, the esc key, and the close button. The titles must be descriptive of the modal's purpose, the button must be a clearly written CTA, a regular popup size not too big nor too small, never exceeding over 50% of the screen. Lastly, to remain focused on the modal window, it is purposely contrasted with the parent page. </p>

            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            <p><b>Date: </b>January 20, 2025</p>
            <p>Form Design Practices has evolved over the years and increasingly improved usability for it's users, still it is inevitable to come across poorly designed forms online. Some key practices that stood out in the article, <a href="urlhttps://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> by Salim Ansari, were not overloading the user with <i>complex</i> form questions first but rather <i>easy form questions first to reduce users form abandonment.</i> Most users are motivated to finish tasks they have started. Another practice that stood out was the use of <i>default values</i> in forms, it is key to do research prior to entering a default value in users forms to prevent submittal errors. Lastly, another practice that stood out to me was the <i>minmization of drop down menus</i> if a dropdown menu has less than 6 options, the designer could opt for radio buttons to easily display the array of options, reduce uneccessary clickks, and easily check multiple options. Overall Salim provided 20 tips to boost usability which were all insightful.</p>

            <p>
                <br>One form that demobstrates a best form practice would be the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/login">Khan Academy's</a> login page, although there are clearly direct labels on top of each input field and various CTA buttons that prompt the user to log in through Google, Apple, Facebook, or Clever.   </p>
